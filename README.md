# bin-scraper
Webscraper for household waste &amp; recycling calendars

Inspired by https://twitter.com/BinDayCator - I wanted to do something similar, but his scraping method didn't look like it would work for my local council's website.

Still to do:
Decide on data format to push to display device (won't know this until I work out how much info it will display - will prob use text based display rather than coloured LEDs
(maybe) scrape data from future months and automatically send email summary
